Ver 1.0.0

This is my first ever original JavaScript project as well as my first React project. 
I learned a lot while building this application as it was also my first time working
with an API and third-party libraries on my own. Admittedly some of the parts in my 
code are probably not the best practice but I tried my best to make my code look clean
while also ensuring that it worked as intended to the best of my current abilities. In 
the future I hope to improve it as my skills as a developer improve. Thanks for 
checking out my project and I hope it is entertaining for you!

List of future improvements:
- Optimize for mobile 
- Add "Flip All" Button and restrict new pack until all current cards are flipped
- Add flipping animation
- Create a true backend 

Ver 1.0.1

Updated links to new pack images.
